        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy to make pan pizza recipe that
            doesn't require much prep. Unlike some other pizza
            recipes, the wet dough allows for much less prep time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dough can be made a mere two hours ahead instead
            of 18+ hours as required by typical pizza recipes,
            leading to a pizza recipe that can be made on weeknights,
            depending on when you like to enjoy dinner.
            The toppings allow for easy variation with ingredients
            you probably have on-hand already like canned tomatoes
            and mozzarella cheese
        </p>

            <li>175 g water</li>
            <li>15 g olive oil (for the pizza pan)</li>
            <li>800 g (28 oz) fresh or canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>15 g Butter</li>
            <li>15 g Olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 onion</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>

            <li>175 g Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Calabrian Chiles, minced</li>
            <li>Sprinkle of oregano</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the dough ingredients to a bowl except for the olive oil, and mix until a sticky dough forms. Set a bowl over top and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce ingredients to a saucepot and place on low heat with a lid over top. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes - Use this time to do dishes, watch tv, grab a workout</li>
            <li>Back at the dough, stretch and knead for about 5 minutes until it passes the windowpane test - tear off a piece and stretch it until very thin and translucent without tearing. Set the bowl over the top and let rise for 30 minutes. Stir the sauce and remove the lid, let simmer for another 30 minutes. - Use this time to do dishes, watch tv, grab a workout</li>
            <li>Turn off the sauce and blend with an immersion blender. Add the chopped basil and adjust the seasoning to taste. Store in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Get out a Detroit-style pizza pan or quarter baking sheet and add the olive oil. Toss the dough in and stretch to the edges until it starts to spring back. Let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C) - Use this time to do dishes, watch tv, grab a workout.</li>
            <li>Top the pizza by laying the chiles and oregano down first and follow with the shredded mozzarella. Spoon over the sauce in 3 strips. Bake for about 20 minutes until the crust is golden brown and crispy and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Slide the cooked pizza onto a cooling rack for 5 minutes before slicing and enjoying.</li>
        </ol>
