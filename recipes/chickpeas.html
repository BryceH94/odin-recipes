        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is my go-to work-from-home lunch meal when I don't 
            have any leftovers or time. All it takes is a can of chickpeas
            and a little time to get a protein boost before I get back
            to a busy day.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 15.5 oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed, patted dry</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2.5 cups chopped mixed tender herbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chickpeas in a large skillet or Dutch oven and add garlic and oil; season with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are crisped and some have split open (these will be the most delicious ones), 10â€“15 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat; stir in herbs.</li>
        </ol>
