# odin-recipes
Recipe project for The Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes
The project will be to make a basic recipes website.

This will develop my html and git knowledge while providing
a baseline project to improve upon with future lessons
like with CSS.
